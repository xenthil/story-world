## Other queries

- Sign out option is missing. Is it required if a user wants to sign in with a different account?
- Can parents create more than one child accounts? If so, mock screen has to be updated accordingly.
- Should guardian view/monitor child's activities or stories created by the child? If agreed, a separate screen is required.
- Can a story be deleted?
- How are we going to pick story of the day/week/month? By just clicking on the **Like** option? In that case, how to handle if more than one stories have same number of likes?
- Should we consider about Landscape mode as we will be supporting multiple form factors (Phones, Tablets & Foldable devices)?
